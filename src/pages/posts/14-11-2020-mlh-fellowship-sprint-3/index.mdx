So we're done with another sprint of the MLH Fellowship. This time the theme was gaming. We were to develop games using any technology like 
Gogdot, Unity, web apps using 3js, etc. Initially the sprint seemed a bit inimidating because I had never worked with anything even remotely related 
to game development before. But nevertheless we took up the challenge and made a game using Godot Engine. 

For this sprint, we had 4 member teams, and I was teamed up with [Preet Shah](https://github.com/shahpreetk), [Shambhavi Aggarwal](https://github.com/agg-shambhavi), and
[Rohan Rout](https://github.com/routrohan), the one who came to be our knight.

Inititally we tried to make a game with Unity, but it was too heavy for our systems, and we would not be able to get anything great done, so 
we decided to go with Godot Engine in the end. For a brief amount of time, we also looked into making an Augmented Reality game using react native, 
but that's a project for another time. 

So what did we build?

### 🕸️ Knight In the Night

It's Halloween 🎃! Rohan dressed as knight was on his way to Trick and Treat 🌆, when he knocked outside the door of a mansion 🏰. The
door seemingly on it's own, opened up revealing a spooky interior of the mansion. Giving no thought to this since it
is Halloween, Rohan entered the house to get some candies. But little did he know that this particular mansion was haunted 👻! Now you
need to help Rohan make his way through the mansion, fighting his way past foes ⚔️. If he makes it past all the enemies, not only he does
he get a large bag of candy 🍭, but since it is a magical night, he shall also get the superpowers of a Knight ✨!
