This is the last blog post of GSoC'20, marking the end of the last coding phase ðŸŽŠ

During the third phase, I mainly worked on implementing the feature to automatically display what survey option should be filled and imporving the UI/UX of the application. 

As I mentioned in my previos blog, during the 2nd phase, I mainly worked on the image labelling part. Once the objects within an image/images are detected,
I used the data obtained to provide a user with suggestions as to which survery option would be most suitable. The system can detect whether a house has katcha or 
pakka outer walls, whether there is a television, a refridgerator, VCR, the number of telephones, etc. A collectio of screenshots of how this looks can be seen below:

After this, I mainly focused on improving the UI/UX of the application. I shifted the application layout from a navigation drawer based layout to a bottom navigation
bar based layout. I also improved the layout of all other activites so that they look better. Screenshots showing those changes can be seen below:
