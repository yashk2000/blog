The theme of this sprint was Developer Tools and Productivity. I was teameed up with <a href=\"https://github.com/shahpreetk\">Preet Shah</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/agg-shambhavi\">Shambhavi Aggarwal</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit\">Rachit Gupta</a> for this sprint.\nWe decided to make a CLI based developer tool called <code class=\"language-text\">gitg0</code>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/gitg0\"><img src=\"https://nodei.co/npm/gitg0.png\" alt=\"NPM\"></a></p>\n<p>gitg0 is a command line tool which makes lives of both project maintainers and contributors easy 😌. How does gitg0 do that❓</p>\n<p><strong>For contributors and developers 👨‍💻</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ever spent 2-3 minutes before working on thinking what to name your branch? ⸙</li>\n<li>After making the changes, spent time on wondering about an appropriate commit message? 🖋️</li>\n<li>After a long hectic day of working, skipped over the commit guidelines followed by your project? 😴</li>\n<li>Felt like your commit message could be a bit better if it had an emoji? ✨</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, gitg0 takes care of all this and much more!\nYou just need to enter the number of the issue you’re working on, and select what kind of issue it is, whether a new feature, ui refactors, documentation, security fixes, etc. gitg0 will do the rest for you. The tool will automatically suggest a branch name, and a commit message as well along with an appropriate emoji if you want one!</p>\n<p>Head over <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/tree/readme#-usage\">here</a> for instructions on how to use gitg0 🎁</p>\n<p><strong>For maintainers 👩‍🔧</strong></p>\n<p>Tired of telling contributors to follow proper commit guidelines? 😫</p>\n<p>Fear no more, gitg0 is here! With gitg0, you can setup a <code class=\"language-text\">.gitgo</code> file and choose exactly what commit guidelines your project follows. You want an emoji? We got you covered. You want to enter a custom set of guidelines? We provide an option for that as well. Just eenter the format in which you want your commits to be, and that is the format in which the commit message that will be shown to contributors when they want to make a commit.</p>\n<p>Head over <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/tree/readme#-usage\">here</a> for instructions on how to do the one time gitgo setup 🎁</p>\n<p><strong>What did we learn?</strong></p>\n<p>This was our first time working on building a CLI Application. Besides this, it was the first time Yash and Rachit worked with JavaScript to this extent. Shambhavi and Preet learned a lot about testing CLI Apps. </p>\n<p><strong>💻 What did we use?</strong></p>\n<p>gitg0 has been developed completely in javascript.</p>\n<p><strong>🔨 Installation</strong></p>\n<p>The tool is available as an npm package over <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitg0\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Before installing the package, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">download and install Node.js</a>.\nThen you can install it by simple running the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> i gitg0</code></pre></div>\n<h3>🎮 Usage</h3>\n<p>Currently, we have the following 6 commands which will make you <strong>Good To Go</strong>, <code class=\"language-text\">gtg</code>:</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg whoami</code></h3>\n<p>As the name suggests this command will help you know what the tool does and how to use the commands right from your terminal.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg config</code></h3>\n<p>This commands should be used on for the first time, while setting up the gitgo configuration. You will be asked a small set of questions regarding your commit and emoji preferences. If you would like to change these preferences sometime in future, you can run this command again to make the changes.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg start</code></h3>\n<p>Everytime you start working on a new issue, just run this command in order for the tool to know which issue you’re working on. After this, the tool will suggest the branch names and commit messages automatically.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg display</code></h3>\n<p>This command can be used to display the branch name and commit that the tool will be suggesting for a particular issue once <code class=\"language-text\">gtg start</code> has been run.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg checkout</code></h3>\n<p>This is a replacement for <code class=\"language-text\">git checkout</code> and will simply checkout with the suggested branch name.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">gtg commit</code></h3>\n<p>This is a replacement for <code class=\"language-text\">git commit</code> and will commit your files once added with the suggested commit message.</p>\n<p><strong>👨‍💻 For contributors</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before contributing do go through the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">Code of Conduct</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contributor Guidelines</a>. 🔧</li>\n<li>If you find any bugs in the application, or a feature you think would be nice to have, please open an <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/issues/new/choose\">issue</a>. 🐞</li>\n<li>Continue reading the rest of the README to get the build instructions. ⛏️</li>\n<li>For detailed information and screenshots of the project, please head over to the project <a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0/wiki\">wiki</a>. 📚</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>🛠️ Setting up the project</strong></p>\n<p>Before setting up the project, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">download and install Node.js</a>.</p>\n<p>After cloning the project, you need to execute the following commands to install and work on the project locally:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># This will install alll the needed dependencies</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># This will install the project from source locally in your system</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> -g ./</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can checkout the project over here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotrachit/gitg0\">GitHub Repo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitg0\">NPM Package</a></li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://socialify.git.ci/dotrachit/gitg0/image?description=1&descriptionEditable=A%20magnificent%20tool%20to%20auto-suggest%20everything%20you%20need%20before%20pushing%20a%20git%20commit.&font=Raleway&forks=1&issues=1&language=1&pattern=Signal&pulls=1&stargazers=1&theme=Dark","width":720},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The fifth sprint of the fellowship.
