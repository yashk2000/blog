This time the theme was gaming. We were to develop games using any technology like\nGogdot, Unity, web apps using 3js, etc. Initially the sprint seemed a bit inimidating because I had never worked with anything even remotely related\nto game development before. But nevertheless we took up the challenge and made a game using Godot Engine. </p>\n<p>For this sprint, we had 4 member teams, and I was teamed up with <a href=\"https://github.com/shahpreetk\">Preet Shah</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/agg-shambhavi\">Shambhavi Aggarwal</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/routrohan\">Rohan Rout</a>, the one who came to be our knight.</p>\n<p>Inititally we tried to make a game with Unity, but it was too heavy for our systems, and we would not be able to get anything great done, so\nwe decided to go with Godot Engine in the end. For a brief amount of time, we also looked into making an Augmented Reality game using react native,\nbut that’s a project for another time. </p>\n<p>So what did we build?</p>\n<h3>🕸️ Knight In the Night</h3>\n<p>It’s Halloween 🎃! Rohan dressed as knight was on his way to Trick and Treat 🌆, when he knocked outside the door of a mansion 🏰. The\ndoor seemingly on it’s own, opened up revealing a spooky interior of the mansion. Giving no thought to this since it\nis Halloween, Rohan entered the house to get some candies. But little did he know that this particular mansion was haunted 👻! Now you\nneed to help Rohan make his way through the mansion, fighting his way past foes ⚔️. If he makes it past all the enemies, not only he does\nhe get a large bag of candy 🍭, but since it is a magical night, he shall also get the superpowers of a Knight ✨!</p>\n<p>Before we proceed, and you decide to install the game: </p>\n<h3>Disclaimer❗</h3>\n<p><strong>Install at your own risk ⚠️</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone involved with the developmnent of the game is working with Godot, or for that matter any game development technology, for the\nfirst time.
