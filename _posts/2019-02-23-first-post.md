If you want to play the guitar you have to concentrate on what you practice and the way you practice it. Being a good guitarist means being exciting, interesting, passionate and musical. Whether you’ve been playing guitar for years, or you’re just getting started, no one is perfect and everyone can improve. Following are some ways to improve your skills.

## 1)  Relax and loosen up

</p>

Removing tension from your body will help you attain greater fluidity, speed and accuracy. But the guitar is a very physical instrument. We’re performing highly unnatural, physically demanding movements and, wouldn’t you know it, our instinctive ways of coping with this are the very things that can hold us back.

As soon as you started paying attention to muscular tension when playing guitar, you started noticing it all the time. Of course, if we’re more relaxed generally, we’ll be more relaxed when we play.

So take a couple of minutes right now to find any unnecessary tension in your body. Start with your neck, then your shoulders, arms and keep working down your body. Try getting into the habit of running this little check on yourself throughout the day and, soon enough, it’ll become second nature.

Before you even pick up your guitar, spend a moment looking for tension in your shoulders, arms and fingers. Take some slow, deep breaths, roll your head around a little, flex your arms and hands – whatever helps you get loose. Then, while playing normally, keep checking to see if you can feel any tension building up, especially in your shoulders and arms, and try to minimise it. Keep checking while you play and, gradually, you should begin to internalise the process and break the habit of tensing up.

## 2)  Check your grip

</p>

There are two grips we talk about when playing the guitar- the way you grip your plectrum and the way your fretting hand grips the guitar.

Most people hold the plectrum between their thumb and first finger. Others use the thumb and first two fingers, thumb and middle finger, etc. Some people plant the side of their palm on the bridge, others anchor their little finger on the face of the guitar. All of these approaches have their benefits and drawbacks and, in my view, rather than aiming to find and adopt one “correct” style, the ideal is to develop the flexibility to adopt the technique that best suits a given playing scenario.

Classical and formally trained guitarists tend to go for a fretting position whereby the thumb is placed at the centre of the back of the neck, with the fingers pressing down more or less perpendicular to the fret board. It might look uncomfortable and awkward, especially compared to the more commonly seen “blues” grip (thumb over the top of the neck and the fingers flatter to the strings), but actually affords a great deal more precision and mobility.

So try working through exercises slowly – perhaps some typical chord changes and some single note lines- and pay attention to your fretting hand and plectrum grip. Look for tension, excess force and uncomfortable angles and try to minimise them.

## 3)  Try new things

</p>

It’s often tempting to stick with what you know, but as a guitarist, you should try to leave your comfort zone as often as possible, discover new ways to play and constantly challenge yourself. Yes, it can be frustrating, and yes it’ll be hard work, but the rewards mastering something brand new are worth it. In a year’s time, you’ll look back with pride to see how far you’ve come!

Try to play the same chord in different positions. For example, take G-major. You can play it in it’s open form and then shift to in bar form and so on. Try this with every chord you know. You not only learn new chord positions but also refine your technique in this way.

## 4)  Practice with a metronome

</p>

This helps in practising the ability to be inside of the music, to be an integral part of what is happening around you, to be able to play even the simplest thing with a laser-like, knife-sharp groove that makes no one want to get up and move.

You should have the metronome on, eyes closed and getting inside of that pulse like you could eat it, chew it, punch it, sweat it. Feel it like it’s right there, like it’s tangible.

To do this requires a lot of patience but never practice without a metronome.

## 5)  Keep track of your progress

</p>

The growth of any guitarist can be improved by the awareness of that growth. As you develop the discipline to be learning and practising on a daily basis, it is important to keep a log or diary of the process of your improvement in order to further maximise growth. The easiest way to do this is to keep a log of your routine. You’ll find that keeping track of your practice will help you focus future practice sessions, maintain and continue awareness of progress and locate particularly fruitful practice phases in your past that can be replicated and upgraded when you feel your growth has stalled.

## 6) Confidence

There is nothing more important than believing in what you do and have to say musically over all else.

Regardless of anything you have to believe that your music is the best and that the world is lucky to hear your  mastery which you have allowed them to witness.

This belief will push you to progress and to perform with a command that others will lack and will inform you ability to constantly develop and take risks with the experimentation necessary for artistic freedom because you will have belief and with belief you need nothing else.

### Nobody knows more about how you can be you than you do.

### Find how you can do that.

### Show the world.
