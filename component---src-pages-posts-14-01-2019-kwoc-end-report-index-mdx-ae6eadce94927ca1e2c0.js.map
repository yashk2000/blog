It also helps students prepare for other open source events such as Google Sumer of Code. The program generally begins in December and goes on for a month till January. I got to know about KWoC form the seniors in my college who had participated in it last year.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This year KWoC began on 5th December 2018 and went on till 10th January 2019. It was a really good experience. I am a newbie to open source and was confused about how to contribute to open source. Initially scared, I slowly began talking to the mentors of the projects I selected. My mentors were really helpful and it is thanks to them that I was able to contribute in KWoC. I contributed to six projects. Being an Android developer, I hunted for all Android projects and started contributing to them. I’ll list all of them and talk about all of them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`1) `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/immadisairaj/Quiz\"\n      }}>{`Quiz App`}</a>{` :`}</p>\n    <p>{`This was the first app which I contributed to. The mentor of the project `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.facebook.com/immadisairaj\"\n      }}>{`Sai Rajendra Immadi`}</a>{` helped me a lot. He patiently answered every query I had, no matter how small. The first contribution I made to the app was a simple button change. Earlier the previous button used to show even on the first question. I made a change so that the button would show up only after the first question.
