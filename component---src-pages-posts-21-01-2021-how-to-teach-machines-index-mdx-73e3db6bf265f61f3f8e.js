Given the trends in weather over the past few years, you can train a model to accept the conditions of a particular day and make it predict the weather for the next day.\nUnsupervised Learning: In supervised learning, we have fixed classes of data, and there will be a right and a wrong answer. Contrary to this, in unsupervised learning, the algorithm will try to find patterns in data, and will try to cluster similar types of data together without actually knowing the real label.
